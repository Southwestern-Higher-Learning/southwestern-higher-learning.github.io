## The Project

The SU Tutor App is a mobile app that assists Southwestern students in finding an official Southwestern tutor. Through the mobile app, students are able to search for and schedule sessions with specified tutors. Tutors are able to create a schedule through the Google Calendar API. Students are able to leave reviews about their tutors and vice-versa. To protect users of the app, a report function was added to report reviews and profiles of users. An admin interface (still in-development) is provided for administrators to specify tutors, create categories, follow up on reports, and more.

There were two teams: frontend and backend. The frontend team was responsible for creating the mobile app in React-Native, a JavaScript library that is able to create apps for both Android and iOS. They were also responsible for interacting with the backend server to provide functionality to the app. The backend team was responsible for creating a REST API for the frontend to use and interact with both the database and Google Calendar API. The backend uses FastAPI, TortoiseORM, PostgreSQL, and Docker. The team utilized Kanban and Extreme Programming methods, specifically pair programming and code reviews.

This purpose of this website is to provide accurate information to students, administrators, and developers about the project.
