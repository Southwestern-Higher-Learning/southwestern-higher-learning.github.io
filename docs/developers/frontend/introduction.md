# Introduction to the Frontend

## Development

The front end is a hybrid mobile application. This means that when compiled, the application will run on both Android and IOS devices. More on how that is accomplished below.

### React Native
React Native is a JavaScript library that is a port of the React framework.
React Native is the base of the front end and what allows us to build a mobile application that is cross platform. React Native translates what would traditionally be a web view into a mobile application.

### React
React is a JavaScript libary made by Facebook and a common framework used to develop UI's. React is popular for it's state management and lightweight compiled applications. The front end relies on React Hooks to manage screen/component/global state, like useState, useEffect, useContext, and useReducer.

### Expo
Expo is a packager that allows us to focus solely on cross platfrom functionality and does a lot of the work in compiling React/React Native into separate native applications for IOS/Android.
