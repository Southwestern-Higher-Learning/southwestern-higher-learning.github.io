# Styling Guide

## Main Focus

Our main focus behind how we wanted this application to look was to make sure that it could be navigated through easily
and was familiar to the our user base. We wanted the user interface to match that of popular social media applications that 
we felt our users used on a daily basis. Being that we are creating this application for Southwestern University, we wanted
to make sure that we also abided by their Branding [Guidelines](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wavuq_d--E8AsPfkWWm8IljCETCkPoVp/view).  

## Background Photos

All of the photos used in this application came from [Southwestern's Campus Photos](https://www.southwestern.edu/marketing-and-communications/media-kit/campus-photos/) page on their website. These photos were taken by the students and faculty of Southwestern University.

## Colors

The color scheme we used for this mobile application came from [Southwestern's Color Palette](https://www.southwestern.edu/marketing-and-communications/style-guide/color-palette/). These are the school colors and being that we made this application for the University, we wanted the colors to match the school colors.
