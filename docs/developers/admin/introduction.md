# Introduction to the Admin Interface

The admin interface was created in React with React-Admin as a framework. The interface can be hosted anywhere that can host static HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. Netlify is the host of choice as it automatically builds the website whenever there is a push to the main branch of the GitHub repository and it handles redirects from Google authentication.
