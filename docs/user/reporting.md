# Reporting

A core principal in this app is that Southwestern Students abide by the [Student Handbook](https://www.southwestern.edu/life-at-southwestern/student-handbook/) and treat other students with respect. This means that if a student decides to use any type of offensive language, they are subject to be reported and disciplined accordingly by Southwestern University. As a way to help monitor the app there are options for the user to choose in order to report students who are abiding by the Southwestern University Handbook and community guidelines.

## Reporting a User

If a user has an inappropriate about me section there is a modal that will pop up that will allow the user to report an about me section for an inappropriate profile image, about me section, or for incorrect profile information. The user can select the issue accordingly and it will be reported to the university.

## When to Report a Review

To help maintain the integrity of the app do not report low rated reviews unless they do not abide by the SU Student Handbook, this includes but not limited to racial slurs, curse words, and sexual language. The purpose of the app is to provide meaningful data to the university to better support the academic guides. Different students have different learning styles and what helps one for one student may not help another. By providing reviews about the tutoring session such as tutoring style, knowledge on the subject, etc. other users should be able to determine if a guide is suitable for their style of learning. Likewise, the students on the app should take careful consideration when reviewing their reviews. The purpose of the reviews is to provide constructive criticism or praise for a guide. Reviews that do not offer meaningful input on a tutoring session should be reported.
