# Reporting

A core principal in this app is that Southwestern Students abide by the student book and treat other students with respect. This means that if a student decides to use any type of offensive language, they are subject to be reported and discplined accordingly by Southwestern Univeristy. As a way to help monitor the app there are options for the user to choose in order to report students who are abiding by the Southwestern Univeristy Handbook and community guidelines.
