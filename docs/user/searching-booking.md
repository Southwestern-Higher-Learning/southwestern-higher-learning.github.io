# Searching and Booking Sessions with Tutors

When searching for tutors, you are able to search either by course subject or by the specific tutor you would like to go to. When you click the search bar, a drop down with those options will
appear and then you can choose from them and search in whichever way you would like.

## What happens after I book a session?

After you have searched for the specific tutor and found the session you want to book, it will automatically create a google calendar item in your google calendar with the times you booked
as well as any information involving that specific booking. It is linked with your student email address so it will be on your google calendar associated with your student email. Once your
time is approaching, you will get a notification saying that you have an upcoming appointment just like you would get any other notification on your mobile device.
